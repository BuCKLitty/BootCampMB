# CoinSquare Case Study

## Overview and Origin

Coinsquare is a Canadian owned and operated Cryptocurrency exchange platform founded in 2014 along with Riot Blockchain who were contracted to help build an exchange platform for cryptocurrency
* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

The financial start-up was brought in to create an exchange for cryptocurrencies to be traded and sent around with increased availability and liquidity, allowing for crypto holders to move assets and send from wallets, allowing legal tender by way of cryptocurrency. 

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
Coinsquare have received at least $30m in funding in 2018 alone, and since incorporation in 2014, have received $98.5m in funding from 4 investors; including Mogo, Riot Blockchain, Nimble Ventures, and Canaccord Genuity Group. 

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

Coinsquare is attempting to provide an exchange where crypto investors can immediately liquidate holdings, and have an online wallet from where they can make payments. Similar to forex trading, this platform will allow investors to have liquid assets that can grow at anytime, and also be utilised immediately. 

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers? 

Coinsquare is targeting all crypto investors, generally following the 25-34 years, predominantly male with interest in volatile markets and high interest in technology and innovation. It is estimated to include 52.4 Million consumers. 

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

Coinsquare, when compared to their competitors, have very low transaction fees. One competitor, Coinbase, has fees that 20 times as high, at 4%. Where Coinsquare has transaction fees totalling .2% and under special circumstances can fall as low as .1%. This means investors can take the money they earn, instead of paying 4% or their profits, or another 4% on top of their losses. 0.1% fees encourage fast and reactive trades and increase engagement, customers will be happier making regular trades with Coinsquare. Whereas with the competition, regular trades will result in a high amount fees. 

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthingâ€“â€“ you may want to search the companyâ€™s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

Coinsquare has implemented Secure Sockets Layer and 2 factor authentication. SSL referring to a technology used to create a private connection between user and server, to assist with customer who are trading or sending currency. Using this tech customers can store passwords or codes or personal information on the exchange without great risk of being hacked or having this information retrieved by anyone except the customer. 2FA refers to ensuring that 2 measures are taken for logon. For example, password, and code sent to a different device owned by the customer, to ensure the user logging in is who they say they are. Coinsquare also uses cold storage, holding 95% of their assets offline. This means the currencies cannot be accessed online.
Coinsquare also uses its own proprietary technology, to ensure consumers and investors cannot be DDoS. 


## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

Coinsquare are a Cryptocurrency Firm, who apply blockchain technology to list cryptocurrencies on an exchange that allows investors from all around the world to trade currency on a regulated an open financial platform. 

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?



* What are the other major companies in this domain?

As Mentioned before, Coinspot are a main competitor, along with eToro, Coinspot, and Binance. These companies also exist as cryptocurrency exchange platforms that are globally accessible and have at least some regulation. All exist to offer similar services, however, as stated above, Coinsquare’s use of cold storage, low fees, and in-house technology separates them from the competitors. 

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

With respect to measurable performance relating to employees, Coinsquare employees have left scathing reviews with 30% reporting the job as disappointing. Citing overwork and lack of work-life balance being contributing factors. Financially, assets owned by Coinsquare increased by 230% in 2020-2021 financial year. As well, annual revenue reached 95 million dollars. Performance has attracted more investment from Mogo, who are looking to acquire over 5 million common shares, increasing their stake to 37%. Coinsquare is now the industry leader in Canada, running as the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the country.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

Coinsquare and other publicly listed crypto exchanges use a few metrics to indicate performance. For example, Asset growth or decline. Because these exchanges hold cryptocurrencies, they make money as the market goes up. Similarly, number of transactions is indicative, average price of transaction as well, these contribute to earnings, and can be used to estimate growth and revenue from fees. Crypto exchanges also track their net profits, employee satisfaction, and number of users domestically and internationally. Profits indicate financial growth, employee surveys give insight to corporate culture, and number of users highlights current market share with in Canada and in the global market.
* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

Coinsquare far exceeds Canadian competition, but globally there are far bigger fish. For example, Coinbase generated revenues of 1.8b in quarter 1 alone, where Coinsquare generated 95m in the fiscal year. Binance, another global competitor grossed 1b in 2019, again dominating that of Coinsquare. 

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

Coinsquare often receive feedback from frustrated investors because transactions can be heavily delayed. Some investors reported 48 hour delays, and for day traders or people who are very active or aggressive in their methodology, this can result in in loss of potential income. I would advise offering instant transactions for traders, money withdrawals and deposits going through immediately so there is as little delay as possible for traders. Other platforms, such as Australian competitor Coinspot are offering these services. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

Allowing traders immediate access would improve engagement, and boost trading activity. Which in turn would lead to more customers by virtue of competitive advantage and user-friendliness. Consequently, more traders means more trades, more trades results in more fees paid. Revenue and customer satisfaction is likely to grow as a result of implementing. 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilise?

Most likely Osko, or an equivalent. Osko is only available in Australia, but this technology allows for instant transfers from bank account to exchange holding account. 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

They allow for instant transfer, which means faster consumer behaviour with less thought. It is easier for investors to buy in a hurry or when prices are increasing. It is also will result in far more transactions, which generates more revenue from fees. Additionally, by offering a new technology new customers will be attracted.
